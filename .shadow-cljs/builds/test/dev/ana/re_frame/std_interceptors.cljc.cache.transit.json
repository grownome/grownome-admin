Eg: that edit\r\n *   just made might have introduced a new duplicate, or removed one. Same with\r\n *   any todo removal. So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\r\n *   associated with the todos list.\r\n * \r\n *   Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\r\n *   for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\r\n *   'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\r\n *   editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\r\n *   approach.\r\n * \r\n *   So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\r\n *   every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\r\n *   reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\r\n *   and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\r\n * \r\n *   https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\r\n * \r\n *   By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\r\n *   we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\r\n *   (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\r\n * \r\n *   We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\r\n *   any CRUD operation.\r\n * \r\n *   This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\r\n *   each time.

Eg: that edit\n  just made might have introduced a new duplicate, or removed one. Same with\n  any todo removal. So we need to re-calculate warnings after any CRUD events\n  associated with the todos list.\n\n  Unless we are careful, we might end up coding subtly different checks\n  for each kind of CRUD operation.  The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change. It will inspect all the todos, and\n  reset ALL FLAGS every time (overwriting what was there previously)\n  and fully recalculate the list of duplicates (displayed at the bottom?).\n\n  https://twitter.com/nathanmarz/status/879722740776939520\n\n  By applying `f` in an `:enrich` interceptor, after every CRUD event,\n  we keep the handlers simple and yet we ensure this important step\n  (of getting warnings right) is not missed on any change.\n\n  We can test `f` easily - it is a pure function - independently of\n  any CRUD operation.\n\n  This brings huge simplicity at the expense of some re-computation\n  each time.
